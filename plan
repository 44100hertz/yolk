Yolk: sideways shmup

You're like a blue egg.
Your "yolk" is your hurtbox (actual hurtbox smaller), and the "white" just gives you presence.
You shoot out of a small mouth made of white.
Your shots are affected by your movement, making things somewhat precise.
Upon firing, a ring on the yolk indicates cooldown time until the next shot.
A single hit kills you.
Omnipresent dark waves at the top and bottom indicate that crossing the screen borders will kill you.
Upon death, your egg explodes, screen shakes, and the level restarts.
Levels are short to accomodate this.
You have a score for encouragement, but the real goal is survival.
The background scrolls and you are shown during the title, but the level does not scroll until you start playing.
Level actors do not activate until a certain distance from screen edge.

Early levels:
Annoying enemies that challenge shooting ability.
Death by foolishness reinforced; distractions.
Single-shot attacks that target you directly.
Easy-to-avoid obstacles.
Medium but never fast pace.
"goofy" bacteria, still feel fairly natural/liquid.
Mid-levels could have animal-esque enemies.

Later levels:
Obstacles that require good shooting in order to avoid death.
Strong enemies, fire becomes overwhelming unless killed.
Several-shot attacks that don't always target you.
Good reactions a requirement.
Corrupted and crystalline designs, contrast with organic feel.

Bosses:
Have their own stage after a set of levels...probably.
Never vulnerable all of the time.
Player has some control over boss pace.
Play with free-floating vs. part-of-stage bosses.
Make them generally reflect the stage beforehand.
No surprises! Bosses should test patience and resolve over raw skills.
A determined player can beat any boss the first time.
